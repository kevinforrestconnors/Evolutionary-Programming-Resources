# Evolutionary-Programming-Resources

## Introduction

Evolutionary Programming can broadly be divided into two categories, Genetic Algorithms, and Artificial Life.  GAs are algorithms that rely on a model of evolution in order to compute something, while Artificial Life aims to simulate life itself.

## Motivation

This repository is primarily intended to provide a resource for myself while I am taking CSC-295, Evolutionary Programming, at Grinnell College.  It provides simple examples of a Genetic Algorithm and an ALife example with Unity/C#.  Both of these methods would be appropriate to implement for general video game life simulations or computations.

## Genetic algorithms

One Genetic Algorithm is shown here.  This algorithm aims to solve the "problem" of turning a random binary string into a string of all 1's.  It does this by creating a simple fitness function `F = Sum(Genome)`.  Asexual reproduction is used, which has the drawback of making large genome length computations particularly slow.

## ALife

Two ALife examples are shown here, Asexual and Sexual methods are given.
